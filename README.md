## **About project**
Our project focused on how to train a RL agent using SS output as input for RL, so we do not cover training the SS model in this project. 

You can see our full project and experiments on Kaggle:  
[Mario Project on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kamuisi/mario-project)

Our work is based on the original project from [Semantic-Segmentation-Boost-Reinforcement-Learning](https://github.com/vpulab/Semantic-Segmentation-Boost-Reinforcement-Learning/tree/69eace77a3437f98b1b437074adee5a578803581/RL)
